## Swagger
To use the Swagger UI 
- Run project 
- Go to URL/apidocs

## Things that could be done better / TODOs 
- Better file structure
- Tests (Unit Tests/E2E/etc)
- Use a more defined architecture like DDD or Clean Architecture
- Have a way to create/delete Users and Tasks
- Prod should use a real WSGI
- Search for a better way to validate params and other external variables
